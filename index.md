## Introductions

### Who am I?
Hi, I'm Orson - CS student at Stony Brook University and Software Engineer. If you want to know more about me you can follow the buttons below but otherwise I'll keep it short and simple ðŸ˜„.

### Contact Information
Emailing me at [orsonjiang@gmail.com](mailto:orsonjiang@gmail.com) is always preferred but if you've found me on an alternative platform I'm happy to communicate through there. And who knows? There might be plans to build a live chat box on this site ðŸ˜‰.

### What is this site?
This is my playground to both test new technologies and talk about them. If you see anything out of place or just want to chat, feel free to reach out.

### What tech stack am I using?
This site is build with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (a Ruby package), and hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The Jekyll theme I'm using is [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/). You can read more about how I setup this site [here](/docs/notes/2022-10-10/).
