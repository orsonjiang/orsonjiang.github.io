## Introduction
Spotify for Car is a web application that allows a group of users to control music from a central output device while utilizing their personal devices. The inspiration for this app came from an issue I discovered while driving with friends. They wanted to add songs to my car's music queue, but passing my phone around would be inconvenient. Eureka! Why not make an app for it?

## Work in Progress ⚠️
As of now the app is live at the link above, however only whitelisted users are allowed access. This is because Spotify has yet to extend the app's quota; therefore, the number of users is limited and must be manually added. While I work through the issue, if you'd still like to use the app, feel free to reach out at [orsonjiang@gmail.com](mailto:orsonjiang@gmail.com) and I would be happy to add you!
